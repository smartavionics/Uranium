##  Base class for output device plugins.
#
#   This class provides the base for any output device plugin that should be
#   registered with the OutputDeviceManager. Each OutputDevicePlugin should
#   implement device detection and add/remove devices as needed.
#
#   For example, the Removable Device plugin searches for removable devices
#   that have been plugged in and creates new OutputDevice objects for each.
#   Additionally, whenever a removable device has been removed, it will remove
#   the OutputDevice object from the OutputDeviceManager.
#
#   \sa OutputDeviceManager
class OutputDevicePlugin(PluginObject):

    # Emitted when a device was added manually.
    # With arguments: plugin-id(str), device-id(str), address(str), (optional) properties(Dict[bytes, bytes])
    # Named ...Signal to avoid confusion with the function-names.
    addManualDeviceSignal = Signal()

    # Emitted when a manually added device was failed to add, or was removed, when failed to add, device-id is empty.
    # With arguments: plugin-id(str), device-id(str), address(str)
    # Named ...Signal to avoid confusion with the function-names.
